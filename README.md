the plucky is an ergodox like split keyboard with a more extreme columnal stagger.  
I took inspiration from splitkb's Kyria and the Ergodox design.

## layouts

The pcb supports the following layouts:
## pcb

- ortho compability (oled/rotary on vertical 1.5u keys)
- tht mini usb

## case

The case is a tray mounted design and 3d printable in two pieces: plate and case

In order to assemble the case you'll need the following additional hardware:

- 4x M2 7+mm screws
- 4x M2 4mm spacers

**Assembly:**  
After you soldered the PCB you can assemble the case. At first you're going to have to merge the spacers with the posts of the case. To do this heat up your soldering iron, position a spacer with a tweezer and press the spacer down with the tip of your soldering iron (make sure it's clean before this step). Do this with the other spacers, align the plate and pcb and fixate it with the screws.

> What where your goals behind designing this keyboard?

One thing I wanted to improve/avoid were keys that needed to be stabilized but at the same time have a wider space key to rest your thumb on.

Another thing I wanted to achieve with this design was to be fairly flexible in terms of keycaps that can be used.  
Personally, I like the wider ergodox style modifier keys but keycap compability is unfortunatelly not that great.  
That's why I made PCB compatible with just 1u keycaps that are offered in ortho keycap sets.

> What's next?

I'd like to add a rotary encoder in my next revision to the pcb.
Probably under the palm or near the thumb cluster.

> What's the story behind the name

I named the keyboard Pluckey after one of my favorite Animal Crossing villagers „Plucky“. The first letter of the logo represents Pluckys eye.
